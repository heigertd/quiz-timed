# quiz-timed
This assignment we had to create a timed quiz. This quiz had to make you lose time for every wrong answer and display previous scores so you can compare your progress. The example had a high score list that displayed the sccores from highest to lowest. I opted to just display previous scores and have a line of text pop up saying what position you were in. My biggest challenge was by far ordering the array of scores in descending value and removing the duplicates. I ended up with a sorting function found on w3 schools to order the array elements and then using an if statement to make a new array and only add unique elements. Overall this assignment helped me get a better grasp on DOM manipulation and utilizing local storage.

Bootstrap was used for formatting
